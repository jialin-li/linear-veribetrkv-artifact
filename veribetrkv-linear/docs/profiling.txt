## quantifier instantiation

To generate a log of quantifier instantiations:
  dafny <source.dfy> /proc:*ProcedureName* /z3opt:smt.qi.profile=true /z3opt:smt.qi.profile_freq=1000 > qi.profile

To display a report/summary:
  ./tools/profile-report

## z3 statistics
To generate the input to z3:
  dafny <source.dfy> /proc:*ProcedureName* /proverLog:log.smt2

Then run z3 directly with statistics enabled:
  .dafny/dafny/Binaries/z3/bin/z3 -st log.smt2

### legacy sorter for quantifier instantiation

Then you can sort them using the following command:
  sort -k 4,4 -k6nr,6 /tmp/qi.log | sort -su -k 4,4 | sort -k6nr,6 | less

- The first sort sorts by source locations (e.g. "source.dfny.16:4"),
  then reverse by instantiation count.  The result is that all entrys
  for a given source location are grouped together, with the highest
  instantiation count for that source location on the first line of that group.

- The second sort stably sorts by source location and outputs only the
  first entry for each group of lines with the same source location.
  Since this is a stable sort on source location, it outputs lines in
  the same order as they were output from the previous sort.  So all
  we're really doing here is the uniqueness operation, i.e. grabbing
  the first line from each group.  So the output from this sort is one
  line per source location, with that source location's highest
  instantiation count.

- The third sort reverse sorts by instantiation count, so the highest
  instantiation counts are at the top of the file.
