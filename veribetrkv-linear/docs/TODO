concurrency

When can we benchmark performance
---------------------------------
1. un-marshall is slow (quadratically building maps?)
   - sstables

2. Background event triggering
   - Flush/split/grow/merge
   - evict/writeback

3. Unrealistic superblock

13. partial reads/writes

5. sub-block query reads
   - bloom filters

7. avoid needless log n descent

9. mutable buffers at root

10. efficient mechanism to merge buffers
    - mutable vectors

12. GC pause benchmark

Publication
-----------

- good perf. benchmark

- handle i/o errors / corruption

- key lifting and file system layer

Maintainability
---------------

- clean up probably duplicate code in lib
