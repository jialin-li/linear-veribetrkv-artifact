1. Allow linear usage by using all fields (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/issues/11)
2. Allow existing vars in linear destruct (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/issues/10)
3. Support for inout assignment for datatypes with more than one constructor (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/issues/9)
4. Convenience: do shared borrow in same line as a linear pass (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/issues/8)
5. Borrowing for statements (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#borrowing-for-statements-not-just-expressions-and-calls)
6. More borrowing within expressions (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#more-borrowing-within-expressions)
7. Linear function method enhancements (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#function-methods)
ds)
8. Linear ghost (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#linear-ghost)
st)
9. Linearity polymorphism (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#linearity-polymorphism)
sm)
10. Destructors (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#destructors)
ors)
11. Write old(x) , not old_x for inout variables.
12. Lambdas should allow linear parameters and return values. (https://github.com/secure-foundations/dafny/blob/betr/docs/Linear/PossibleChanges.md#linear-in-lambdas)
